##TEI Coding 
 
###Introduction

Hello, welcome back to my blog. Recently,  I’ve been given the opportunity to assist with creating a digital edition of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s _The Yellow Wall-paper_.  _The Yellow Wall-paper_ was originally published in January of 1892. The piece is regarded as a significant work of early American feminist literature. The work  illustrates the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the 19th century. Working with a piece that has such a historical impact made me very excited about this opportunity.

###The Process

The process began with a copy of one of the sections in Stetson’s manuscript. That manuscript was translated into a word document; I held the responsibility of translating the document into digital format. A key element of my task was ensuring that the digital format remained consistent with the manuscript; this included maintaining page beginnings, paragraphs sections, weird spacing,underlined words, misspelled words, etc..

###Tools Used

My task was accomplished using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and The Oxygen XML Editor. Originally I didn't understand TEI well, so I did some research. According to [tei-c.org](https://tei-c.org/) “TEI is a consortium which collectively develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in digital form. Its chief deliverable is a set of Guidelines which specify encoding methods for machine-readable texts”. TEI is commonly used in digital humanities. It is useful for the preservation of text, which was an element of my task. Oxygen XML was the application I translated the document into. 
 
###Early Troubles 

This was my first introduction to TEI and Oxygen. It caused a bit of anxiety at first, due to the fact that I’m not a very tech savvy person. I usually attempt to avoid any technical tasks. At first, I originally had several questions about the TEI codes. The main thing that confused me was incorporating the codes into the paragraphs correctly. Also, the layout of Oxygen was a lot to take in at first glance as well. Although I was nervous about using this application, I decided to put that aside and work hard to understand it. The piece of literature was much more important than my fear of using a busy looking XML editor to markup the text.

###Conclusion

After marking up the first paragraph in the section assigned to myself, I realized that the task was much more simple than I anticipated. Incorporating the codes into the paragraphs was easy and I adjusted to the busy application layout. I was able to markup my entire section pretty fast and actually mastered the basics. The work was definitely tedious, but worth it. Through this assignment, I was able to gain new knowledge on coding and contribute to preserving history.
