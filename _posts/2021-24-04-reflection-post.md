# The End
The end of an era is near. The final days of Digital Humanities (DH) are approaching, and there are many things to reflect on. Digital humanities was a foreign concept to me when I first embarked on this journey. However, today it has become very familiar. The last step of this journey is a [Grant Project Proposal](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2021/engl350spring2021/grant), because of the work completed prior I am confident in my abilities to conquer this task.

## The Digital Humanities Journey
I simply decided to take digital humanities this semester because my major required a second writing-intensive and it was referred to me. I went into the class thinking I wouldn’t gain much out of it, and that the course would be more creative writing focused, with some digital elements. These original thoughts have turned out to be incorrect. My idea of digital humanities has completely changed. As I reflect on digital humanities today, DH  in my eyes is the ability to utilize interactive technology tools in a way that helps further educate individuals on humanities subjects. This personal definition of digital humanities grew from the different readings and assignments that I had to complete throughout the semester. The different readings included: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, _The Humanities, Done Digitally_, Jason Heppler, _What is Digital Humanities_, Anne Burdick, et. al., _A Short Guide to the Digital_Humanities_, Alok Amatya, _For Beginners, What Makes a Good DH Project?_, Simon Appleford and Jennifer Guiliano, _Best Practice Principles of Designing Your First Project_ and more. The different assignments included twitter posts, review blog posts, and TEI coding. 

## The Impact
Completing these different assignments and readings has been very helpful in assisting my understanding of digital humanities. In particular, I’d have to say that the review blog posts have prepared me the most for my last step in digital humanities and with my understanding of the subject. These posts were stressful at times and often made me want to give up. However, the award outweighs the stress. Completing review blog posts required me to deeply study other digital humanities projects and through the studying of each project, I was able to develop a fuller understanding of what digital humanities is. I studied how the technology and humanity elements of each project are merged together, and these elements showcased the true essence of digital humanities. Reading the different papers assigned this semester greatly helped as well. In particular, Anne Burdick’s “A short guide to the digital humanities” has been a piece that really stuck with me. It is the first reading that allowed me to believe that I could tackle the task of actually creating my own digital humanities project. The impact of these assignments and readings has not only helped me understand digital humanities better but they have also allowed me to gain skills with HTML, blogging, creating grant project proposals, and more. 

## The Last Step
My last step within digital humanities for this semester is creating a grant project proposal of my own. Overall the process has been very smooth and I believe that is largely due to the impact of the tasks that were given before this one. The digital humanities project I am proposing is titled Diversity in American Young Adult Literature. The project studies the difference between diversity representation in young adult books versus the reality of the United States population today. This project topic is of interest to me because I am a minority in America and the literature I read in school didn’t often have protagonists that look like me.
Throughout the process of creating this grant proposal, my project topic has remained consistent. The process has included research, creating an abstract, and creating a great narrative. The research part of my proposal helped me complete an environmental scan. During this part of the process, I was able to find similar projects and websites to my concept. For example, Jenny Kimura's blog post titled “Where Are All the People of Color on Young Adult Book Covers?” is a source that gave me ideas for how I wanted to design graphs on my proposal website. And this blog also further proved to me that my project had a purpose. Creating an abstract and grant narrative for this proposal changed the way I thought about my topic. They made me really focus on describing my topic to potential investors. I had to understand the value and importance of my project, and not just look at it as a creative idea within my head. 

## The End
Taking on digital humanities this semester has proved to be feasible. The class scared me in many ways at first, however, I’m glad I remained dedicated to improving. Working on digital humanities assignments has beneficially impacted me in other areas of my life. This course has given me a better edge in the marketing field, and it has helped me write and research better. With a clearer understanding of digital humanities, I took on creating my own digital humanities project, and I have fallen in love with the project. Working on this final project has allowed me to be creative and to study new familiar areas while gaining new significant skills.
