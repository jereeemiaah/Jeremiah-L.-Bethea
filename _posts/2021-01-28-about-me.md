Hello, welcome to my blog! 
Funny enough, I’ve been told by many people that I should start a blog. I’ve always said that I would never do that; I guess we truly never know what the future has in store for us.

For my first blog post I want to allow you all to get to know me, Jeremiah L. Bethea, a little better. I am a second semester senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/).
My major is _Business Marketing_ and my minor is _Psychology_. At CNU I’ve managed to stay involved throughout the years. I originally came to the school for track and field, I was a pole vaulter. I currently spend most of my free time planning events for the professional business fraternity on campus, Alpha Kappa Psi. I’m the current Vice President of Activities. This semester I also enrolled in a course called _Digital Humanities_ which is the reason for the creation of this blog. The course was recommended to me by a friend and I took that advice into consideration because I think the skills that are taught in this course will be beneficial to my future career goals. 

As a second semester senior I am currently in the job finding process, which is very scary and exciting at the same time. My dream is to work in the digital branding industry and I believe that I will gather knowledge in this course that will assist me in that industry. I’d also like to move to the west coast when I graduate. At the age of 15 I fell in love with southern california, San Diego to be more exact. Since the age of 15 I’ve been travelling there pretty consistently as well so I’m very familiar with the area. Here’s a photo I took two weeks ago during my latest visit to California.  

While in California I also celebrated my 22nd birthday. This year's birthday was all I could ask for. I was surrounded by friends and loved ones, in one of my most favorite places on earth and I felt complete peace. During this year's birthday I reflected a lot on how grateful I am for my life and the things I’ve been able to accomplish in just 22 years. As I take the last strides towards graduation, I hope to continue accomplishing things that make me proud and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me.
