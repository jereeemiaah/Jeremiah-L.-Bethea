### What is Digital Aponte?

Linda M. Rodriguez and Ada Ferrer combined their collaborative efforts to curate [Digital Aponte](http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/); a website which is dedicated to the life and work of _Jose Antonio Aponte_. The Digital Aponte website invites an interdisciplinary collaboration that is said to model the collaborative approach Aponte used in his creative, intellectual, and political efforts. This site allows viewers from across all different fields and specialties to have a revolutionary experience while studying a revolutionary man. The curators provide the viewers with assistance for engaging with the archives and flawed records left behind; but the element of freedom is an important aspect of Digital Aponte.

### How does Jose Antonio Aponte factor into Digital Aponte?

Jose Antonio Aponte lived during the period of colonial Cuba. Aponte was a free man of color, carpenter, artist and allegedly a leader of a massive anti-slavery conspiracy and rebellion between the years of 1811-1812. During Aponte’s life he created an unusual work of art. This was known as the “Book of Paintings”, which is full  of historical and mythical figures, including black kings, emperors, priests, and soldiers. The book is said to be lost. However, the Digital Aponte website gives viewers the opportunity to explore Aponte’s world and artistry, which may have lead him to create the  “Book of Paintings”, with intellectual freedom.The website is separated through different tabs but there's no distinctive order, so readers can start and finish however they would like. Digital Aponte was created with digital humanities elements. Viewers are able to discover interesting knowledge about the history of Jose Antonio Aponte while using creative and interactive digital tools. 

### Is it Digital Humanities?

Some of the main aspects of Digital Aponte which reveal its digital humanities elements are the recreation of [Aponte's Library](http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/apontes-library/), the [Image Gallery](http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/havana-visual-culture/) and [Aponte’s Havana](http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/apontes-havana/). The recreation of Aponte’s library gives viewers the opportunity to understand the wide range of topics which Aponte was interested in. The library is made up of a dozen volumes across a wide range of topics. In the Aponte’s library tab there are interactive aspects as well. In this tab there’s a subtitle that reads “click on any book pine to learn more”. Viewers can move their cursors over a number of books and with one click they can instantly learn more about that novel. Each novel contains annotations from other scholars about how they identified the particular novel. Site users are also able to consider learning about the visual aspects of Aponte’s time. In the image gallery there're many different art pieces that can be interacted with and studied to gather a greater understanding of Aponte’s life. The thumbnails in the image gallery have links to separate pages with contextual information on them. Lastly, Aponte’s Havana allows site users to view an interactive map of Havana plot sites relevant to Aponte’s life and also locations he represented in his novels. 

### Conclusion

Digital Aponte appropriately accomplishes the majority of the goals that the web creators set out for it.  The website does invite the site viewers to an interdisciplinary collaboration in some forms of the website; however, this could be improved upon throughout the site. The recreation of Aponte’s library encompases the creator's goal for the website extremely well. Site users can read the novels in the library and leave commentary, which can then be viewed by others and built upon. This type of collaboration could also be useful in other forms with the Image Gallery and Aponte’s Havana to fully accomplish the creators goal and enhance the site viewer's overall experience. In the image gallery some of the pieces are scarce on information, so the creators could offer the option for viewers to add more information about the pieces of art. This type of collaboration could also be added to the Aponte’s Havana map. The map is currently lacking photos. However, having viewers submit appropriate pictures from specific areas would assist with the map's overall goal.As a whole, Digital Aponte is able to attract viewers and expand their knowledge of _Jose Antonio Aponte_ in a creative way.
