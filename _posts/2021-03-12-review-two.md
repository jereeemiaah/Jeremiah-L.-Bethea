## Summary 
In 2017 Tara Morton created [_Mapping Women’s Suffrage_](https://www.mappingwomenssuffrage.org.uk/suffrage-map). The project website design and development is accredited to Paul Grove and Tim Hollies. The Votes for the Women campaign resulted in an extensive battle in which many different individuals participated in. In England during 1911, the suffrage campaign reached its peak; several individuals had become active members of this battle for the Women Campaign. Morton uses _Mapping Women’s Suffrage_ to illustrate the different individuals who supported this movement in England during 1911; using the resources of today. An interactive map to identify the different voters is an aspect of this website. The website also incorporates many other features to express the importance of this history still today.

## Layout Tour
The website _Mapping Women Suffrage_ has a sleek and simple layout. When viewers enter the website they are instantly welcome to a site header and the different social media platforms mapping women's suffrage has. After that introduction, the eye focuses on all of the different tabs the website has to offer; which are “home”, “about the project”, “suffrage map and biographies”, “suffrage blogs and news, resources”, “get involved”, and “contact us”.
 
## Suffrage Map & Biographies Tab
The _Suffrage Map & Biographies_ tab is used to express the mission of this project. On this tab, viewers are instantly introduced to a map with several colored circles. At first glance, the circles and their purpose can be confusing due to the lack of description. However, after studying the map it can be realized that each circle is used to identify individuals who supported the women's campaign in England during 1911. When a visitor clicks on a circle they are able to find out a voter's gender, age, marital status, address, census response, suffrage society, and read a biographical text.

The suffrage society element of the map is significant. The circles on the map are categorized by color; each circle color represents the suffrage society that each voter was a member of. This aspect of the map can be confusing at first. The information on the right side of the map that allows site visitors to manipulate the circles based on suffrage society is abbreviated. Without prior knowledge of suffrage societies, individuals wouldn't understand how to properly manipulate the map using the insufficient information given. However, there is a guide at the bottom of the tab that elaborates on the different societies featured on the map. 
 
The map may also be manipulated by the voter’s census response and map style. The census response element of the map fits well with the overall project topic. However, the purpose of the different map styles is unclear, but it is a cool feature to play around with. 
 
The map used on this tab is a feature from the digital program [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). The desktop view of the map does not fit within the entire range of this tab so it can be hard for viewers to decipher where it ends and starts as well. The creator could attempt to change the size of the map to make it easier to view for cite viewers.
 
 
## Preserving the Importance
Morton successfully gets across the importance of this history still today. She is able to do this by giving site visitors different avenues to interact with this subject matter. On the site there is a tab titled _Suffrage Blogs & News_; on the tab different blogs, events, news information and research on this topic is presented. This tab is also interactive, so viewers can like and comment on material. The website has a tab titled _Resources_; here site visitors can find articles, videos, podcasts and other websites related to this topic. Morton uses a _Get Involved_ tab to inspire site visitors to get involved with this topic as well. 
 
## Conclusion
Overall _Mapping Women's Suffrage_ is presented well. The main goal of identifying and locating voters, of the women's campaign in England during 1911, is executed. Through exploring the interactive map, site visitors can learn many details about several Voters. The map and information that relates to understanding it fully could be rearranged to make the site even more user-friendly. A few important things associated with the map, such as the guide and option to view the map in full screen, would be more effective at the top of the tab. However, the site’s creator makes it clear that the site is a work in progress and constantly being improved to run more efficiently.
